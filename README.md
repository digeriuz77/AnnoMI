# AnnoMI
Official repository for the AnnoMI dataset: the first public collection of expert-annotated MI transcripts.

Research  on  natural  language  processing  approaches  toanalysing counselling dialogues has seen substantial development in recent years, but access to this area remains extremely limited, due to the lack of publicly available expert-annotated therapy conversations. We introduce AnnoMI, the first publicly and freely accessible dataset of professionally  transcribed  dialogues  demonstrating  high-and low-quality motivational interviewing (MI), an effective counselling technique, with annotations on key MI aspects by domain experts.

PLEASE NOTE: the dataset is currently being processed and will be released upon ICASSP 2022 acceptance.
